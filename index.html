            <h1>Hi there!</h1>
            <p>
              I am Barakat! I have a passion for continuous learning and
              personal development. I have years of experience designing and
              improving the visual identity of brands with commitment to
              producing quality designs. Currently, my focus is on building
              exceptional digital and customer experiences.

            <h2>My experience</h2>
            <p>
              Being a self-motivated and continuous learner, I have been able to
              grow in my career through learning, acquiring and implementing key
              skills, particularly design, data analysis, marketing and
              management skills. I have worked with brands as a graphic designer
              and helped build and improve their visual identity to generate
              leads. Currely, I am a Partner Manager working with reputable
              organisations to help them and their clients to save cost and
              optimise their Microsoft 365 license usage.
